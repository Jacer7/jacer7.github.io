	        <p>I am an Electronics and Communication engineer. I am currently working at Gorkha Brewery - Part of Carlsberg Group as a commercial automation executive. I am involved in a multi million software project for the sales team.</p>
	        <p>I strongly believe that hard work always pays off rather than the luck. As myself being an engineering student I found that the degree alone cannot give you the better job, or if become one then it is very hard to be satisfied on what we are doing. To compel this and resemble with oneâ€™s personal attributes of likes and dislikes, it is very important to know what we want to become, this sentence is the one where I don't want to put full-stop </p>
	        <p> I am continuosly improving my skills, i am always into learning new, its just give me the satisfaction, being competitive enough makes me proud,  i can really talk about that things confidently !!</p>
	        <p >As a front-end developer i will show what can be done in the CSS. And in another project i will implemet the JavaScript in this same website.</p>
